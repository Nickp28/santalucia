<p class="coffee-details">Our passion begins in Nicaragua, the home of Santa Lucia’s Single Origin, Farm Direct Coffee. Our beans come from only one region of one country of origin. Yet, Santa Lucia is a uniquely integrated Direct Trade program known for its distinct quality and exceptional cup.  Without any middleman we have kept out one level of distribution and it has allowed us keep costs lower and offer our premium product at a more affordable price.</p>

<p class="coffee-details">Acclaimed by Wine Spectator for our “rich earthy chocolateness balanced by good acidity”. Our Specialty grade 100% Arabica Coffee speaks for itself in the cup with its great aroma, pure flavor, body and delicate tones. With subtle difference that are shown in the cup all our beans remain the same, Single Origin Nicaraguan.  As with all Central American beans, they are Medium Bodied in Character and differentiated by their specific roasts. Our roast profiles have been painstakingly crafted to bring out our coffee's best taste as well as aroma.</p>
