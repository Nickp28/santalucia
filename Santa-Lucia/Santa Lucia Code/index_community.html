  <hr class="line-block">

  <p>As we source our beans we have always believed in Farm responsibility and with fair pricing, we always pay a premium to the grower for their beans. Giving back to the workers and their families is something we are proud of and is a huge incentive in our world. The Farms provides us with the beautiful premium coffee cherries that produce a great cup allowing us to support better ways of life for many connected to the Farms. Additionally as we support the city that drinks our coffee most (Washington DC area), Santa Lucia participates with many charities in the tri-state area annually. Stop by one of these great Chef driven events, sample a cup and say hello!</p>
